It has also been confirmed that this is zwack and slip's son. Proof here. On Friday, May 22nd, Hoot Boot's mail feature was removed and replaced with MailMan. This was due to an overwhelming about of complaints received by the Repl.it Team, Hoot Boot loved to repeat the phrase \"This conversation has been closed or expired. Sending a new message will start a new conversation.\" Hoot Boot is now unemployed. It is unclear whether or not it can qualify for unemployment insurance. See also: Hoot Boot's Ghost",

There have been four total versions of the rules by former admins. ([timchen](https://ReplDex.mat1.repl.co/entry/timchen), [katya](https://ReplDex.mat1.repl.co/entry/katya), [zwack](https://ReplDex.mat1.repl.co/entry/zwack), [enigma](https://ReplDex.mat1.repl.co/entry/enigma)).\n The current rules are:\n - Be kind and respectful to others. Feel free to reach out to a mod or staff member if there's any confusion about what this means.\n - No spam or advertising.   Your repls must go in the designated channel. Links to your programming streams must go in #programming.\n - Use each channel for its intended purpose. If you're not sure what the purpose is, ask in [#oof-topic](https://ReplDex.mat1.repl.co/entry/oof-topic).\n - Arguments about what language / framework / lib is the best in a certain context belongs in #lang-debate.\n - This server is English only.\n - We enforce the Discord ToS.\n - Keep it SFW, so don't use swear words, certain allusions, hate speech, etc.\n - NO doxing under any circumstances.\n - Do not argue with a moderator's decision publicly. If you feel that what they did is unfair, please contact an admin or use the bot   to resolve the issue.\n  \n Helping Guidelines:\n - Help people appropriately.\n - There are no stupid questions! Be patient - everyone starts somewhere. Things that are simple for you may be hard for others.\n - Do not spoon-feed, or just give them the correct code. This halts learning.\n  \n -Keep the discussion on the server, if possible.\n -We can't moderate DMs, but if someone DMs you and makes you uncomfortable please report it to us ASAP and we will handle it the best we can.\n -Asking a question in DMs will be seen as a offense now.\n -The moderators will use appropriate measurements if you break a rule, such as muting   you for a certain time, or even banning or kicking you.  \n  \n -Do not include characters that are not easily typeable on a standard us k\u0334\u033e\u035de\u0335\u033d\u034ay\u0336\u030e\u0309b\u0336\u0342\u0352\u00f6\u0338\u0301\u0309\u0103\u0336\u031ar\u0335\u030b\u0311d\u0337\u0310\u0360 in your username",

The rules were changed on October 18th, 2020, due to protests and riots in the weeks prior. This time, it added some guidelines for moderators, which will hopefully curb mod-abuse.

For some reason [Edwin](https://repldex.mat1.repl.co/entry/Edwin) really likes this movie.\n  \n Zootopia was directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore, and produced by Clark Spencer. The movie follows Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin, young Judy Hopps voiced by Della Saba) as she faces sexism from co-workers in the Zootopia Police Department. On Hopps' first day on parking duty, [Nick Wilde](https://ReplDex.mat1.repl.co/entry/Nick+Wilde) (voiced by Jason Bateman, young Nick Wilde voiced by Kate Soucie) tricks her into buying a large sweet to \"provide for his son.\" Wilde actually resells its juice, and gets caught by Hopps. Yadda yadda yadda, more exposition happens, and then Nick and Judy end up fighting crime together.",

They are extremely annoying and obnoxious and are looked down upon. Notable Cycle Wh-res include PattanAhmed (the second biggest), rohilpatel (the biggest), and TheUnkownCoder. Q & A Q: What makes a Cycle Wh-re a cycle wh-re? Everyone does it in some way or another. A: If a person has added MARKDOWN or some other sort of styling in a share/tutorial post to make a \"please upvote\" more notable, it is a cycle wh-re. Casually pointing it out inside normal text is fine. Q: When can I say, Please mark as the correct answer? A: Only after the person has acknowledged that you answered his question and has not marked your answer as the correct one, only then can you ask to mark as correct answer. Q: What happens if I am a Cycle Wh-re? A: You get looked down upon and the CYCLEWH*RESTAPO may come and kidnap you to low-effort camp.",

	  "nohtml_content": "In early August people where thinking \"Nothing could possibly go wrong this month,\" and they were correct (for the least part)\u2026 unless you are a part of the Repl.it Discord. Why? Because Bramley became a trial mod (or Guardian) for the Discord. This shocked everyone (but it turns out Bram's not that bad\u2026) and many people made theories on why the Repl.it team decided to do that. One theory that absolutely no-one knows or cares about is a theory made by k9chelsea2, that if you nitro-boosted the server at a certain time you would be promoted as guardian. This theory exists because Eelboi (who also was boosting the server) got promoted to guardian at the same time. Piero (Who was boosting the server at the time) also became part of the Repl.it Team. If this theory is correct then it has a worrying outcome because it means that the likes of Courtney could also be made a guardian. A new theory is that the Repl.it team decided to eat poisonous potatoes that clouded their judgement, hence why bramley is now a guardian.",

Only issue is, Brittany had no programming experience at the time. Using Repl.it Britanny attempted to learn how to make a website over the course of seven weeks. Every week she would write out a Replit blog post talking about the process on the upcoming website. This blog series was called Anyone Can Code, and was written out very well.
